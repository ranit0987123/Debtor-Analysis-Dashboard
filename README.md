Debtor Analysis Dashboard: Understanding Outstanding Payments Made Simple
Introduction
Managing debtors is crucial for any business. Knowing who owes you money, how much, and for how long is important for maintaining healthy cash flow. The Debtor Analysis Dashboard simplifies this process by giving you a clear and easy way to track and analyze debtor information.

Why Debtor Analysis Matters
When businesses donâ€™t stay on top of their debtors, it can lead to delayed cash inflows, financial stress, and even losses. A dashboard helps you:

Track Outstanding Payments: Know exactly how much money is due and from whom.
Identify Late Payers: Spot customers who consistently delay payments.
Improve Cash Flow: Take timely action to recover overdue payments.
Plan Better: Use data to forecast and make informed decisions about credit policies.
What the Dashboard Shows
This dashboard is packed with useful visuals and information, such as:

Aging Analysis: See how long payments have been overdue (e.g., 30 days, 60 days, 90 days).
Customer Performance: Find out which customers are prompt and which ones are delaying payments.
Payment Trends: Track patterns in payments over time to spot recurring issues.
Receivable Breakdown: Understand how much is due by region, customer, or time frame.
